A porn blocklist for ublock origin

To create a block list for pornographic websites in uBlock Origin, you can manually add URLs of porn sites or use a pre-existing filter list. Here's a step-by-step guide to block these sites effectively:
Step-by-Step Guide:

    Open uBlock Origin Settings:
        Click the uBlock Origin icon in your browser's toolbar.
        Click the "Dashboard" (gear icon).

    Add a Custom Filter:
        Go to the "My filters" tab.
        Paste the domains or URLs of pornographic websites you want to block.

    Example:

    plaintext

||examplepornsite.com^
||anotherpornsite.com^

This will block access to those sites.

Use a Pre-existing Filter List: Many community-maintained lists already exist to block adult content. Here's how to add one:

    Go to the "Filter lists" tab.
    Scroll down to "Custom" and click "Import."
    Paste the URL of a porn-blocking list into the textbox.
